#summary Installation Hints
#labels Featured,Phase-Deploy

= Prerequisites =

  1. gnu make
  1. working erlang installation.
     * debian: aptitude install erlang-dev
     * os/x (with [http://www.finkproject.org/ fink]): apt-get install erlang-otp
     * freebsd: pkg_add -r erlang
     * others: ???
  1. [http://support.process-one.net/doc/display/CONTRIBS/EUnit eunit] from process one; optional but 'make check' will not do anything without it.

= Installing =

The project uses automake.  The default prefix is /usr; if you don't like that, use the {{{--prefix}}} option to configure.

Running {{{make check}}} is strongly suggested.

The project is distributed as a set of patches.  At build time it tries to
find your current version of mnesia and patch it.  If this is successful,
then it will end up creating a version of mnesia with a version equal
to the version you have installed plus "ext" plus the version of 
the extensions.  For instance, right now, version 0 of the extensions 
has been released, so on a system running mnesia-4.3.5, a successful 
build and install will install as mnesia-4.3.5ext0.

= Tested Platforms =

  * Ubuntu 32 Linux (gusty) with mnesia-4.3.5 .
  * OS/X 10.4 i386 with mnesia-4.3.5 (installed via fink).
